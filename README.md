# Programmer Folklore
This project is a collection of programmer folklore gathered for BYU's ENGL391 class.

There are several stereotypes of the programmer that might lead folklorists to believe they do not have their own folklore tradition: after all, they are antisocial and spend all their time staring at a computer screen alone. While most programmers admit that these stereotypes have more than a grain of truth, in reality there is a strong, shared culture around programming born of common struggles and insider knowledge. Like all shared cultures, it generates folklore.

This folklore is non-traditional in one critical way: it is often *not* performed face-to-face. Much of programmer folklore (maybe even most) is performed digitally, and created and engaged with in solitude. (Given the aforementioned programmer stereotypes, this is perhaps not surprising.)

However, programmer folklore has other features of folklore: it is traditional, often artistic, and highly variable. It also still fulfills common functions of folklore, including reinforcing cultural norms and establishing a sense of identity.

The rest of this README will comment on and analyze the folklore items I collected personally for this project.

(A README is traditional file found once in every `git` project, whose function is to provide an overview of the purpose and usage of the project, as well as any important implementation details or limitations.)

# About This Project
Github (the website this project is hosted on) is a project hosting site that uses the version control system `git`. To other programmers, Github may seem a strange choice for a project containing no code. However, this project is designed to document and explore programmer culture through its folklore. Version control is an essential programming tool, and `git` in particular allows for many people to contribute in parallel to a project with seamless integration of every contribution. (Well... anyone who's had a merge conflict may beg to differ.) This pattern of collaborative contribution is a core part of programmer culture, and I wanted this project to reflect that. Folklore itself is fluid and collaborative, so this format felt doubly fitting. 

So if you come across some programmer folklore in the wild, feel free to make a pull request and document it here! (Please obtain permission from the source and include it in the documentation, unless the source is anonymous or unknown.)
