**Contributor Names:** Samuel Owens

**Contributor Data:** Early twenties, white male. Undergraduate student at Brigham Young University and Teaching Assistant (TA) for the same Computer Science class I TA for. He is a coworker of mine. 

**Social Data:** The joke was told in a "Gather room" while Samuel and I were on the clock but there weren't any students waiting to be helped. A Gather room is our class's digital alternative to a TA lab due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The website, gather.town, provides meeting rooms using a 2-D video-game-like setting, where the rooms can be customized to have seating, tables, and whiteboards. Each person has a little avatar they can use to walk around the room. When they get close to another person, a video feed from that person's webcam pops up at the top of the screen, and you can hear their voice. You can have several people in range at once, and you can have private conversations by "sitting" in the chairs. This replicates the feeling of gathering in a real TA lab very well, and my conversation with Sam was almost identical to what it would have been in-person.

We were chatting casually about programming things, and I asked him if he knew any good programming jokes. I told one of my favorites, and he responded with this folklore item. I hadn't heard this joke before, and I thought it was pretty funny.

**Cultural Data:** Java and C are both programming languages. C is pronounced like the word "see," hence the oral pun. C is generally considered to be a more difficult programming language to use than C, because C is a "lower level" programming language and doesn't abstract away as many technical details of how the computer works at a 1s and 0s level as other programming languages do. There is significant rivalry between programmers who prefer different programming languages, and so there are whole categories of programmer jokes and memes insulting those who use a different language than the teller. Most commonly, these jokes insult those who use higher-level languages, as if programmers who use low-level languages are better or smarter because programming in those languages is perceived as more difficult. This joke is an example of this genre, since it implies that Java programmers are inherently not good at the "more difficult" C language.
