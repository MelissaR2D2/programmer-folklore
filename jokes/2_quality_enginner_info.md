**Social Data:** Reddit is a social media site focused on link sharing, though in the last few years it has shifted focus to sharing original content. The site is divided into "subreddits," each focused on specific topics. Content is posted as "Reddit threads" that users can then comment on. Users can reply to other users' comments, creating a forum for discussion of the content posted. Reddit has a broad user base, but is generally considered to be most popular with young white males. It often reposts or links to content from Twitter and other social media sites. This folklore item comes from the ProgrammerHumor subreddit, a subreddit dedicated to sharing programming memes and jokes. This makes it a great place to find and engage in programmer folklore.

This joke was posted as a comment on a Reddit thread. The Reddit thread shared a humorous video (potentially from a sitcom) of a man going to enormous lengths to break a hotel bed by bouncing on it. The man is labeled "TESTER" and the bed is labeled "MY CODE."

**Cultural Data:**  The original Reddit post is a joke/meme about the rigorous testing computer programs should undergo before being deployed into widespread use. In software development, the people whose job it is to do this testing are called "testers" or "quality engineers." One comment on this post gave the opinion that the upsetting part of being a tester was trying to come up with every possible way to break the code in the normal course of use, but then after the program is deployed, the bug reports that come in are all from the end user doing something completely insane or even malicious. This is a common problem in software development - it is very difficult to not only anticipate all the right ways users will use the product, but also all the wrong ways. 

This discussion prompted woodwalker700 to reply with the folklore item, which is a "walk into the bar" joke highly applicable to the testing woes being discussed, as it gives an example of programmers hyper-focusing on one type of potential bug (valid input for what the user orders at the bar), and does not consider broader use cases (like the very natural question of where is the bathroom).
