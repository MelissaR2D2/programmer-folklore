This is the story of how programming errors came to be called bugs, as told to me at some point early in my programming career. Way back in the 1960's or '70s, when computers were still the size of rooms and used vacuum tubes and enormous transistors and all that sort of thing, the programmers (this may have happened at NASA, I don't remember specifically) kept noticing incorrect output from one of the big computing machines. So they check and re-checked the punch cards or whatever early coding method they were using to give the machine instructions, but everything was correct. So they had to examine the whole machine, and they finally found the problem: a small moth — a bug — had flown into one of the transistors or vacuum tubes or something, got electrocuted, and died, causing a short in part of the system. The programmers pulled the dead moth out of the machine and pressed it in a notebook recording their results, labeling it "BUG." So over time more and more people started calling computer errors "bugs."
