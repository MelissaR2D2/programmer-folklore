The other version of why software glitches are called bugs that comes from my programmer son-in-law goes like this: it comes from the days of tall ship sailing where food was difficult to keep fresh during a long voyage. So they ate a lot of what is called hard tack. Kind of a big nasty dry cracker/buiscuit [sic] type thing that will chip your teeth if you are not careful according to disgruntled sailors (and soldiers who ate it also in the army). During the voyage, insects and other bugs get in the hard tack and eat it. So, before sailors ate it they would, “get the bugs out,” by shaking it, banging it on something, or pulling it apart and inspecting it until the bugs all fell out.
