**Contributor Data:** Professor of folklore at Brigham Young University. Male, 40s, white. Heard the folklore item from his programmer son-in-law.

**Social Data:** I was discussing programmer folklore in preparation for this project over the phone with Professor Eliason, and I told him the story of "The Literal Bug in the Computer." He responded with this variant of the legend, which he heard from his programmer son-in-law.

**Cultural Data:** The term "bug" is programmer jargon that refers to any inherent problem with a computer program, specifically a problem that causes it not to run or to produce the wrong results. These problems are almost always the result of an error on the programmer's part, and it is up to the programmer to find and eliminate them. (Rarely, the problem may be a bug in code the programmer didn't write but is relying on, or even more rarely, a problem with the machine hardware.) The term "bug" has a host of related terms, like "debugging," which is the process of eliminating bugs in a programmer's code through rigorous testing and refinement. 

This story most likely is specifically the etiological legend of the term "debugging," which is what the sailors in the story probably called the process of getting all the bugs out of the tack. Programmers must have then likened to that "debugging" to the process of eliminating errors from their code, and so "debugging" took on its technical definition, and "bug" logically followed to refer to a particular error. 

I will note that, until I heard this story, I had no a significant variation of this etiological legend besides the "Literal Bug in the Computer" version existed. I suspect this variation is not as common, because I've heard the "Literal Bug in the Computer" version many times from different sources over the years, but I would not be able to validate that assumption without much more extensive surveying.
