**Social Data:** Discord is a social media messaging app that organizes communities into "servers" where the members of the community can chat. It is primarily used as a chat app, but also has voice and video calls. Discord servers are usually organized into "channels," which are essentially separate chat threads. These channels are usually organized by topic, in order to keep conversations organized and easier to moderate. This meme was posted in the #memes channel on the BYU unofficial Discord server for Computer Science students. It's a semi-public server in that anyone with the invite link can join, but unless you're a BYU Computer Science student or take Computer Science classes, you're unlikely to find the link, which is usually passed between friends or given out during CS classes. 

The #memes channel on this Discord server is open to all memes, but often the memes are specifically programming or tech-related. Sometimes people will discuss the memes posted, or "react" to them using Discord "reactions," which are just emojis that can be appended to particular Discord message to express some emotion about the message. This meme did not spark any particular reactions or discussions, but I found it funny and highly typical of a particular type of programming meme, so I chose to include it in my project.

**Cultural Data:** Programmers (and, by extension, people with Computer Science degrees, because while not all programmers have CS degrees, pretty much everyone with a CS degree is a programmer) spend a lot of time working with computers and learning how they work. However, computers are so complex that no one can possibly learn everything about them. Even very experienced programmers will have entire domains of computer knowledge they know very little about. Unfortunately, these distinctions are not obvious to non-programmers, and laymen often think that because someone is a programmer or has a Computer Science degree, they know everything about and can fix anything tech-related. In fact, programmer's knowledge is mostly limited to how to write efficient code to make programs or execute certain tasks automatically. Tasks like installing programs, removing viruses, fixing printers, and other computer maintenance are actually best done by an IT (Information Technology) person. This is a completely different specialty and job market, and at Brigham Young University and may other universities it's actually an entirely separate major.

So this meme expresses programmers' irritation at this common misunderstanding of their jobs. It also expresses the more general irritation at relatives who repeatedly assume you can and will do something for them just because of what your job is or what you are studying.
