**Social Data:** Slack is a social media messaging app that organizes instant messaging for small groups. It is primarily aimed at workplaces and is often used in tech jobs, especially during COVID-19 when working from home. Slack servers are usually organized into "channels," which are essentially separate chat threads. These channels are usually organized by topic, in order to keep conversations organized. This meme was posted in the #random channel of the Slack server for a Brigham Young University Computer Science class I am taking. We can see here that many people "reacted" to this meme with the emojis at the bottom of the message with a "crying laughing" emoji, so the meme was well-received. This meme is particularly notable because the professor himself responded to it and agreed with it, as shown in the screenshot. 

**Cultural Data:** Coding is complex and difficult. There is often no single "right" way to code something, because not only does the code have to do what you want it to, it may also need to adhere to time and data storage restrictions. It also needs to be easily expandable and understandable by other programmers. There are coding "best practices" that help programmers achieve this, but there will always be a significant amount of difficult decision-making. Because of this, programmers may freely give best-practice advice to other programmers, but struggle to apply that advice to their own code. This meme creates humor from that juxtaposition, with the hyperbole of a crashing car as a metaphor for the programmer's code.
