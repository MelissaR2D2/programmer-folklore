**Contributor Data:** Brigham Young University student attending a live remote computer science class. Male, but name redacted for privacy because I could not contact him directly. 

**Social Data:** Zoom is a video meeting app whose use became widespread during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, it is being used by a BYU computer science class as a substitute for in-person instruction. The professor has his camera on and lectures to the class, often using Zoom's "screen share" feature to show content from his computer screen. Most students do not have their cameras on. They occasionally speak to ask questions, but more often questions or comments are typed into the Zoom chat box, where they are visible to everyone but do not audibly disrupt the flow of the lesson. 

Bob stating this proverb was precipitated by the professor discussing an upcoming coding project and urging students to plan it out fully before beginning to write the code, so they would understand the scope and process of the project. 

**Cultural Data:** This proverb summarizes and reinforces the programming principle of planning out code before writing it. Because code is often complex and abstract, with many separate parts that must fit together or behave in highly specific ways, a good programmer will plan out each of these parts before writing any code. This is often most easily done in a physical medium, such as pen and paper or a whiteboard, because it allows the programmer to draw free-form diagrams.

The proverb emphasizes the importance of planning in a humorous way that follows the incongruity principle of a joke: it is ridiculous to suggest that spending 3 hours doing something somehow saves 15 minutes. However, considering the context it is usually uttered in (discussing the necessity of planning), I consider it a proverb and not a joke. Bob, recognizing a situation where this principle was applicable, agreed with and reinforced the professor's message by stating the proverb. Several students agreed with Bob's statement, as seen by the replies to the message. (The ^ character represents an arrow pointing up at what was just said in agreement). Another student vents frustration by taking the time exaggeration further with "I think it's more like 10 hours on a keyboard..."
