**Social Data:** Slack is a social media messaging app that organizes instant messaging for small groups. It is primarily aimed at workplaces and is often used in tech jobs, especially during COVID-19 when working from home. Slack servers are usually organized into "channels," which are essentially separate chat threads. These channels are usually organized by topic, in order to keep conversations organized. This message was posted as a reply to a student's question in a project-specific thread about which of two assignments to do first.

**Cultural Data:** This proverb is a variant of the general "Code Planning" proverb as seen in my "Paper Beats Keyboard" item. It summarizes and reinforces the programming principle of planning out code before writing it. Because code is often complex and abstract, with many separate parts that must fit together or behave in highly specific ways, a good programmer will plan out each of these parts before writing any code.

The variation of the proverb similarly the importance of planning in a humorous way that follows the incongruity principle of a joke: it is ridiculous to suggest that spending 20 hours doing something somehow saves 30 minutes. However, because of the context it is usually uttered in (as a recommendation, or generally when discussing the necessity of planning), I consider it a proverb and not a joke. Notably, Bob uses Slack's quote syntax to state the proverb (the little gray line on the left indicates the text is a quote). However, he is not directly quoting anyone else in the Slack. This shows that he doesn't take ownership of this particular statement, but feels he is simply quoting a general, unattributable saying. Clearly, the statement is functioning as a proverb.
