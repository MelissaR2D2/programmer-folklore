**Social Data:** Reddit is a social media site focused on link sharing, though in the last few years it has shifted focus to sharing original content. The site is divided into "subreddits," each focused on specific topics. Content is posted as "Reddit threads" that users can then comment on. Users can reply to other users' comments, creating a forum for discussion of the content posted. Reddit has a broad user base, but is generally considered to be most popular with young white males. It often reposts or links to content from Twitter and other social media sites. This folklore item comes from the ProgrammerHumor subreddit, a subreddit dedicated to sharing programming memes and jokes. This makes it a great place to find and engage in programmer folklore.

This post is 7 months old, but it is among the top posts of the ProgrammerHumor subreddit in the past year (you can view the top posts of a subreddit by day, month, year, and all time, to get a feel for its most popular content). It is also one of my personal favorite programmer proverbs, so I felt I would be amiss not to include it.

**Cultural Data:** One could probably reduce almost every function of computers down to the statement: "computers do stuff for you." Computers are constantly performing billions of computations per second, all of which would be at best very tedious and at worst impossible to do by hand. However, all of these computations come with a cost: programmers have to spend time writing the code that provides the instructions to do it. As a result, you can basically summarize a programmer's entire job as "writing instructions to get computers to do things for me." In short, a programmer's entire job is to automate things. We are trained to see inefficiency and automate it away. 

Unfortunately, not everything can or should be automated, and that's the point of this proverb. Many programmers' first instinct, when faced with a task, is to try to automate it. But most of the time, automating a task is more difficult and time-consuming (but also more interesting and fun) than simply doing it once by hand, and you may not even be able to automate it to your satisfaction. All too often, this task will only ever need to be done once, making the cost-benefit analysis of automation vs. doing it by hand extremely obvious. 

And yet, programmers still often decide to automate it, only to spend far more time than it would have taken to do by hand trying to write the code, and eventually giving up and doing it by hand anyway. Hence this proverb. Like other programmer proverbs, it is humorously tongue-in-check, prescribing the inefficient, but often taken, course of action instead of what should actually be done in this situation.

The title of the Reddit post, "\*cries in powershell\*" implies that ode26 often falls into this automation trap, and relates to the Tweet specifically because of their experiences with Powershell. (Powershell is a programming language that is most often used for task automation.)
