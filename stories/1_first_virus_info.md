**Social Data:** Discord is a social media messaging app that organizes communities into "servers" where the members of the community can chat. It is primarily used as a chat app, but also has voice and video calls. Discord servers are usually organized into "channels," which are essentially separate chat threads. These channels are usually organized by topic, in order to keep conversations organized and easier to moderate. It's a semi-public server in that anyone with the invite link can join, but unless you're a BYU Computer Science student or take Computer Science classes, you're unlikely to find the link, which is usually passed between friends or given out during CS classes. 

This conversation was held in the #offtopic channel, because it was not related to BYU and was part of a larger conversation that only indirectly related to Computer Science. We were talking about various class projects and homework, and I mentioned I was looking for interesting programming stories. jt shared this story, and in return I shared one of my favorites (not collected here) called the [500-mile-bug](https://web.mit.edu/jemorris/humor/500-miles).

**Cultural Data:** A computer virus is defined as any malicious program that spreads between computers. These days viruses typically spread when users unknowingly download a deceptive file, but before extensive computer security protections, viruses could spread over any network connection without much to stop them. (Even today those kind of viruses exist, they are just more rare because they have to get around the security measures.) In this story of the first virus, the programmer just wanted to see how many computers were connected to each other by having each computer send the program to every computer it was connected to than counting up how many computers had received it. However, because he didn't check if the computers already had the program, the program got copied over and over again until it filled up the computers' memory and crashed them.

jt doesn't date this story, but it probably took place in the 1980s, because that was when universities were first connecting their computers to each other to create the pre-Internet. Note that he finds it important to find a source for the story, looking for a Wikipedia article to corroborate it. Due to the significant amount of time programmers spend using the Internet to get correct information (programmers often have to Google features of programming languages, or other computer science details, because it's difficult to remember many detailed rules of highly specific tools and programming languages), I suspect that programmers are more inclined to go searching for the "definitive" versions of such stories, as told through Wikipedia or other digital records, and link directly to them rather than re-telling the content.

(I believe [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_worm) is the Wikipedia entry jt was looking for. Not unexpectedly, some of the details of exactly what caused the program to spread so fast, and the original creator's motivations, were simplified in jt's retelling.)

I don't consider this an etiological legend because it doesn't claim to tell *how* viruses came to be, just the story of the first known virus.
