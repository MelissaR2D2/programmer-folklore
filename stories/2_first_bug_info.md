**Genre:** Etiological Legend

**Title** The Literal Bug in the Computer

**Media** Text. (The original media was a phone call, where I told this story verbally to Professor Eric Eliason (see "Bugs in Biscuits"), but I don't have a recording of that conversation available, so I paraphrased/retold it from memory.)

**Contributor Data** Melissa Robertson, 20, white, F, undergraduate student at Brigham Young University studying Computer Science

**Social Data:** I unfortunately have absolutely no idea where I first heard this story. It was likely in one of my early programming classes, but it could have also been on the Internet. I probably heard it for the first time in 2017 or 2018, when I first started programming.

Like I said above, I told this story over the phone to Professor Eric Eliason while discussing programmer folklore in preparation for this project. He thought it was a cool story and told me about a variant he had heard from his son-in-law, which I had never heard before. That variant is recorded as "Bugs in Biscuits."

**Cultural Data:** The term "bug" is programmer jargon that refers to any inherent problem with a computer program, specifically a problem that causes it not to run or to produce the wrong results. These problems are almost always the result of an error on the programmer's part, and it is up to the programmer to find and eliminate them. (Rarely, the problem may be a bug in code the programmer didn't write but is relying on, or even more rarely, a problem with the machine hardware.) The term "bug" has a host of related terms, like "debugging," which is the process of eliminating bugs in a programmer's code through rigorous testing and refinement. This story tells how how the term "bug" came to mean "programming error."
