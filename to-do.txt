I think the final format of my project will look like this: a zipped file (.zip) containing a folder with a specific structure 
& organization of my folklore items and analysis, along with a word document explaining the organization of the project 
(I wanted to organize and present this project as if it were one of my coding projects). The zipped folder will also be 
hosted on another website, one that programmers use to manage their projects, and I'll include the link to that in the 
word document, because the way the website formats it will provide the best viewing experience.
