**Genre:** Tradition

**Title** "Rubber Duck Debugging"

**Location:** A channel on one of the Brigham Young University LearningSuite software engineering team's Discord server, shared with me as a screenshot on the unofficial BYU Computer Science Discord server.

**Media:** A Discord channel (and the messages in it). Recorded as a screenshot. (PNG image)

**Date and Time Created:** The contributor did not tell me when the channel was first made, but the screenshot was taken on 11/30/2020 and the messages shown span from August - October 2020.

**Length of Exchange:** Several months (August - October 2020), although the messages are all likely unrelated due to their time gap and subject matter.

**Date Accessed:** 11/30/2020

**Contributor Names:** Taylor Whitlock. (He is the person with the red censor bar - at the time I didn't know if he wanted his real name recorded or a pseudonym.) The other people are his coworkers, whose names are redacted because I don't know them personally. 

**Contributor Data:** Taylor is a undergraduate student at Brigham Young University who works for LearningSuite, BYU's online gradebook. He is a white male in his 20s. Other contributor data for his coworkers is not available.

**Social Data:** Discord is a social media messaging app that organizes communities into "servers" where the members of the community can chat. It is primarily used as a chat app, but also has voice and video calls. Discord servers are usually organized into "channels," which are essentially separate chat threads. These channels are usually organized by topic, in order to keep conversations organized and easier to moderate. In this case, Taylor's workplace uses a Discord server to communicate, and has an entire channel dedicated to facilitating the "rubber duck debugging" tradition.

Taylor shared this with me when I mentioned rubber duck debugging as a tradition that I had once engaged in during a summer internship, but hadn't done so recently. The wider conversation concerned our homework loads, and also our folklore projects, since Taylor is taking the same folklore class this project was created for.

**Cultural Data:** Sometimes it's really hard for programmers to find and fix the problems in their code (a process called "debugging"). After staring at the same code for hours, nothing feels real anymore and it's hard to see the code objectively. 
"Rubber duck debugging" is a debugging tradition that helps programmers figure out the problem with their code faster. The programmer simply explains their program, step by step, in great detail, to a toy rubber duck. (Yes, really.) Even though the duck can't respond, the act of explaining the problem to a hypothetical outsider who doesn't know anything about the specific program forces the programmer to look at their code in a different way and may reveal glaring flaws the programmer otherwise would not notice.

Note that "rubber duck debugging" doesn't have to be performed with a literal toy rubber duck, though programmers do buy rubber ducks for each other as a joke because of the tradition. (Taylor told me his team's office is decorated with rubber ducks, and I also own a few rubber ducks because of this tradition.) However, any inanimate object, pet, or even another human being works, as shown by the meme posted as the last message in this #rubber-duck-debugging Discord channel. Earlier, Taylor calls one of his coworkers a "good rubber duck," implying that said coworker listened to him explain a problem he was having, and his simple act of listening helped Taylor fix the problem. Above that, we see an example of one of Taylor's coworkers explaining a problem they are having in a Discord message, and although no one specifically responds, it doesn't matter - this coworker was using the channel itself as a rubber duck.
