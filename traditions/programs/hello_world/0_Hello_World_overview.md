# Hello World

The Hello World program is an extremely simple computer program that can be written in almost any programming language. All it does is print the text “Hello World!” to the screen. The exact capitalization and punctuation varies, but the words "hello world" are near-universal. 

A Hello World program looks different in every programming language because of the different syntax rules. However, in most (non-joke) programming languages, a Hello World program is recognizable at a glance to a programmers. (Exceptions include programs in joke programming languages, and programs whose code is written to be deliberately convoluted and difficult to read. These are sometimes written as a joke, hobby, or challenge.)

## Usage
The Hello World program is an important piece of programmer folklore because it is often the very first program any new programmer writes. It’s often the first example given by teachers, courses, and online coding tutorials. 
 
 However, this tradition is not limited to new programmers: experienced programmers also commonly write Hello World programs when learning a new language or setting up their coding environment on a new machine, because getting this simple program to run confirms that you’ve correctly installed the tools needed to make and run programs in that language. It is so prevalent that some IDE’s (specialized text editors used to write code) even auto-generate a Hello World program when you start a new project.

 ## Function as Folklore
 Hello World is one of the purest examples of programmer tradition. While printing a single line to the screen is a very simple program, and its simplicity allows it to fulfill specific, useful coding purposes, printing the specific phrase "hello world" is as arbitrary as it is traditional. However, knowing and participating in this tradition by using the specific phrase reinforces a collective programmer identity.
