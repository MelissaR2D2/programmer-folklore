**Social Data:** I created this Hello World program, which is written in the Python programming language, in May 2019. (It so happens that Python is probably the simplest programming language to write “Hello World” in, so the program is only one line long.) 

To the best of my memory, I wrote it because I was preparing to start a technical internship that used Python, and I had not written code in Python in a long time. I quickly wrote this program and tried to run it in order to jog my memory and check my computer could run Python code, since I'd had some trouble in the past. This specific instance was a solitary activity, but I was taught this tradition orally by my high school programming teacher on practically our first day of class, and I am certain it was the first program I ever wrote, though that specific file has been sadly lost to time. Since then, every time I have started learning a new programming language, I have written a “Hello World” program in that language.
