**Genre:** Custom/Material Culture

**Title:** Hello World with Valgrind

**Media:** C++ program

**Date and Time Created:** January 2019 (approx.)

**Length of Engagement:** Unknown, likely 15-20 minutes to set the code editor up, then write and run the program.

**Contributor Names:** Tyla Merrill

**Contributor Data:** 20, F, Caucasian. Junior at Brigham Young University majoring in Computer Science.

**Social Data:** Tyla created this program by herself on her Windows laptop, most likely using a code editor called Visual Studio. She commented in an email to me: "I think I made this program at the beginning of CS 235; I probably copied and pasted it from some provided code. I think I was trying to get Visual Studio set up and working, and maybe testing Valgrind too?"

Note that the creation was a solitary act and the admission to likely copying/pasting all or part of the code - it is very common for programmers to copy and paste code from other sources and adapt it to their needs, and it is generally not particularly frowned upon except in academic settings, or when the programmer doesn't actually understand what the code does (which means it could have unintended side effects).

**Cultural Data:** This is an example of the Hello World program being used not as an introduction to a programming language, but as a setup tool. Tyla already knew how to write code in C++, but she was setting up a new code editor in preparation for a more advanced class. Valgrind is a tool used to check for "memory leaks," a type of bug where storage used by your program becomes inaccessible, but is never deleted. This type of mistake is easy to make and hard to track down, which is why external tools like Valgrind exist to find where the leaks are happening. 

This Hello World program looks more complex than other Hello World Programs because of the extra code for Valgrind setup, and because of C++'s more rigid structure.
