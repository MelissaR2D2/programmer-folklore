**Social Data:** Reddit is a social media site focused on link sharing, though in the last few years it has shifted focus to sharing original content. The site is divided into "subreddits," each focused on specific topics. Content is posted as "Reddit threads" that users can then comment on. Users can reply to other users' comments, creating a forum for discussion of the content posted. Reddit has a broad user base, but is generally considered to be most popular with young white males. It often reposts or links to content from Twitter and other social media sites. This folklore item comes from the ProgrammerHumor subreddit, a subreddit dedicated to sharing programming memes and jokes. This makes it a great place to find and engage in programmer folklore.

This program was posted as a comment on a Reddit thread, responding to the content of the thread, which was a meme of Gru (a character from the animated movie Despicable Me) pointing a gun at the reader, captioned with 
"OH, YOU'RE A PROGRAMMER
WRITE A LINE OF LINUX"

**Cultural Data:** The original meme's source of humor is that Linux is not a programming language. It is an operating system like MacOS and Windows, and so it doesn't make sense to ask a programmer to write "a line of Linux." Gru in the meme is demanding that the reader prove themselves a "real" programmer, while it's clear from the ignorance of his demand that he is not a "real" programmer, and that in his eagerness to police the reader, he revealed himself a fraud. 

UniquePtrBigEndian's comment, which contains the Hello World Folklore item, is a joking response to the meme's challenge. The Hello World program is written in bash, a programming language that is closely associated with the Linux operating system because it is often used to automate tasks on Linux computers. That is why UniquePtrBigEndian says "I guess bash counts" and writes the program in that language.

What makes this Hello World program a joke program is its third line: rm -rf * --no-preserve-root / . This line is a command that deletes all the files on the user's computer, even the "root" operating system, without asking for confirmation for any of the files deleted. So although the program prints "Hello world" as all "Hello world" programs do, it then deletes your entire computer. This line is obviously a very dangerous command, and is sometimes spread around or given to inexperienced programmers looking for help with something as a practical joke. Writing this line of "Linux code" as an answer to the meme's challenge, would, in a hypothetical situation where this challenge was given offline, delete the challenger's entire computer, and so UniquePtrBigEndian would get revenge for the challenge to his status as a programmer.

This folklore item is a unique combination of two folklore traditions: the Hello World program, and the rm -rf * practical joke.
